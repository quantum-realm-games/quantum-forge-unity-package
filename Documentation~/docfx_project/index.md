# Welcome to Quantum Forge ðŸ§ªðŸŽ®
For developers pushing the boundaries of gameplay design, **Quantum Forge** offers a foundation for creating the next generation of quantum-native games.

Born of a desire to make it easy to integrate genuine quantum physics into game design, this project took years of experimentationâ€”including lessons learned while creating [Quantum Chess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/453870/Quantum_Chess/). The resulting toolkit reflects countless iterations, late nights, and thought experiments. Designed to make the quantum realm more accessible, **Quantum Forge** opens the door to creating games that break free from classical constraints.

Now, it's your turn. Whether you're here to experiment, prototype, or launch something groundbreaking, weâ€™re excited to have you with us.

If you believe in this vision and want to help push the boundaries of what's possible at the intersection of quantum mechanics and game design, consider supporting the project.
